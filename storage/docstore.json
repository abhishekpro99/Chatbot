All Panasonic \nmembers should put into practice the Basic Management Objective, the Company Creed, and the Seven Principles that form the basis of \nour management philosophy. We are committed to adhering to these principles and we share them with our customers, suppliers, business \npartners, shareholders and other stakeholders. On October 1, 2021 in view of our transition to a new operating company system with the \naim of implementing autonomous responsible management, we significantly updated our Basic Business Philosophy taking into account \nthe changes in social conditions and the business environment. The Basic Business Philosophy is the foundation for our practice to \"devote \nourselves to the progress and development of society and the well-being of people through our business activities, thereby enhancing the \nquality of life throughout the world\", as set out in the Basic Management Objective.\nEach of us at Panasonic must maximize and demonstrate our abilities and skills, clearly identify our ideal end state, share opinions that \nshould be shared, make high-quality decisions speedily by integrating different opinions from diverse employees, and make untiring \nimprovements. By doing so, we aim to be unrivalled in contributing to our customers and society. We must always take an honest look at the \ncurrent situation, and if it conflicts with the direction of society, or if there is a better way, we will not hesitate to choose a new and better \npath promptly. We must put these basic values and principles into practice every day.\nOur Basic Business Philosophy describes the practice of social justice, which is fundamental to our role as a responsible corporate \ncitizen, and establishes the foundation for ethical corporate compliance. As a \"public entity of society\", we conduct our business using \nthe managerial resources entrusted by society, so we must utilize these resources correctly for the benefit of society, and fulfill our \nresponsibilities to the parties concerned. In addition to not violating laws and regulations, we must always consider what is right for society, \nand behave with integrity and with a sense of fair play. In order to do so, we must acquire proven wisdom and put it into practice. The \ntireless implementation of social justice will contribute to the true development of society, industry and our business partners. \nIn addition to outlining our commitment to society, our Basic Business Philosophy also provides important guidance for us on how to manage \nour relationships with stakeholders on behalf of Panasonic in an ethical and compliant manner, including respect for the co-existence and \nmutual prosperity of stakeholders, respect for diversity, contribution to harmony with the global environment, and corporate social responsibility. \nThis Panasonic Group Code of Ethics & Compliance (this \"Code\") sets out \u201cOur commitments\u201d (the commitments that each Panasonic \nGroup company must fulfill) and \u201cMy commitments\u201d (the commitments that each Panasonic member must fulfill).

All Panasonic \nmembers should put into practice the Basic Management Objective, the Company Creed, and the Seven Principles that form the basis of \nour management philosophy. We are committed to adhering to these principles and we share them with our customers, suppliers, business \npartners, shareholders and other stakeholders. On October 1, 2021 in view of our transition to a new operating company system with the \naim of implementing autonomous responsible management, we significantly updated our Basic Business Philosophy taking into account \nthe changes in social conditions and the business environment. The Basic Business Philosophy is the foundation for our practice to \"devote \nourselves to the progress and development of society and the well-being of people through our business activities, thereby enhancing the \nquality of life throughout the world\", as set out in the Basic Management Objective.\nEach of us at Panasonic must maximize and demonstrate our abilities and skills, clearly identify our ideal end state, share opinions that \nshould be shared, make high-quality decisions speedily by integrating different opinions from diverse employees, and make untiring \nimprovements. By doing so, we aim to be unrivalled in contributing to our customers and society. We must always take an honest look at the \ncurrent situation, and if it conflicts with the direction of society, or if there is a better way, we will not hesitate to choose a new and better \npath promptly. We must put these basic values and principles into practice every day.\nOur Basic Business Philosophy describes the practice of social justice, which is fundamental to our role as a responsible corporate \ncitizen, and establishes the foundation for ethical corporate compliance. As a \"public entity of society\", we conduct our business using \nthe managerial resources entrusted by society, so we must utilize these resources correctly for the benefit of society, and fulfill our \nresponsibilities to the parties concerned. In addition to not violating laws and regulations, we must always consider what is right for society, \nand behave with integrity and with a sense of fair play. In order to do so, we must acquire proven wisdom and put it into practice. The \ntireless implementation of social justice will contribute to the true development of society, industry and our business partners. \nIn addition to outlining our commitment to society, our Basic Business Philosophy also provides important guidance for us on how to manage \nour relationships with stakeholders on behalf of Panasonic in an ethical and compliant manner, including respect for the co-existence and \nmutual prosperity of stakeholders, respect for diversity, contribution to harmony with the global environment, and corporate social responsibility. \nThis Panasonic Group Code of Ethics & Compliance (this \"Code\") sets out \u201cOur commitments\u201d (the commitments that each Panasonic \nGroup company must fulfill) and \u201cMy commitments\u201d (the commitments that each Panasonic member must fulfill).
